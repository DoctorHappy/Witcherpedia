May waste an action and 3 Speed to place a trap on his current Row.  
Each group of Trappers can only trap one row. If the Trappers want to place
another trap in another turn, they will need to disarm the trap, which costs an
action and 1 Speed.  
The trap can harm (D8+2) units, dealing 1 damage, and if they are Heavy units,
or Charging Cavalry of any kind, they are damaged before attacking.

If enemy melee units attack allied units on that Row the trap was placed, they
are damaged by the trap. If enemy Medium or Heavy Infantry/Cavalry try to cross
the Trapper’s Row where a trap was placed, they are damaged as well. Note that
there’s a limited amount of units that can be harmed each turn (basically, it’s
n\*[D8+2], where n=the number of Trappers that place a trap)

When performing an Ambush, on the first combat round, the Trappers can freely
place a trap in any row and then move to a completely different row, as if they
have unlimited movement. This however consumes the Dual-Action bonus of the
Ambush.

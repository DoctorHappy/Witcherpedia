The Northern Wars - Board Game

A Tale of Cringe and Bullshittery

Unit Statistics and Properties \#1

Redania

Redania’s army emphasizes the use of heavily armoured melee divisions, usually
comprised of the wealthy and noble families. The Redanian steeds, famous for
their strength and agility, accompany the highly praised knights, equipped with
lances and swords, and the Wild Ones, children of noble families who find solace
battling and pillaging, into the thick of battle.  
Behind them, forming the collarbone, stands the Royal Infantry, the Elites,
donned in plate-mail, alongside heavy Halberdiers and various ranged divisions.  
Even rock Trolls have enlisted, assaulting anything that’s not dressed in Red,
while Eternal Fire’s zealots, the Witch Hunters seek to take down enemy
spellcasters.

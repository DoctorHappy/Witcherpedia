The Northern Wars - Board Game
==============================

**A Tale of Cringe and Bullshittery**

### Kaedwen

#### Overview

The army of Kaedwen has been majorly shaped by its eccentric climate, and its
eccentric ruler. The vast majority of the soldiers are generally poor, and that
is depicted on their half-decent armours and weaponry, but their discipline is
rock-solid, as they are being constantly coordinated by the significant amount
of high-ranking officers who fight beside them.  

The thing that actually made Kaedwen a military force to be reckoned, is its
outstanding cavalry, the Dun Banner. These (in)famous vsadniki, known for their
characteristic Beaver hats, spread terror and disarray into enemy lines, giving
enough momentum for their infantry comrades to break through.  

In the back lines, protected from the onslaught, lies the Kaedweni artillery,
war machines of death, that are massively produced in extreme amounts, compared
to other kingdoms. The siege units are supported by capable engineers, who
oversee and protect King Henselt’s “children”. Frequently acting as artillery,
the mages from Ban Ard harass the opposing troops with storms, or conjure
gigantic critters to aid them.

------------------------------------

with some advanced destructive, cursing and summoning spells

### Name: Kestrel Whirlwinds

### Name: Summon Insectoid Nest

**Type**: Summoning Spell  
**Essence Cost**: 50  
**Cooldown**: Once per battle  
**Specifics**:  
Summons a Random Insectoid Nest, that randomly spawns creatures every 3 turns,
based on a D4 Roll based on the table below:

| D4 |                      |               |
|----|----------------------|---------------|
| 1  | Arachas Nest         | Stats Can     |
| 2  | Endrega Nest         | Be Found      |
| 3  | Giant Centipede Nest | At The        |
| 4  | Kikimore Nest        | Bestiary File |

After the second batch of Insectoids is summoned -in the 4th turn-, the Nest
itself shows up, having 20 Hit Points.  
The nest can be destroyed with Magic and Siege attacks only, and the insectoids
will stop spawning. Siege units attacking the nest act like attacking enemy
Siege -so they have reduced strength-  
Witcher bombs like Grapeshot will instantly kill the nest.  
If the Ban Ard tutor that casted this spell dies in combat, the nest becomes
neutral and attacks everyone. If the battle is over, and the nest is still
standing, it occupies the square, acting as a Neutral Monster Nest. If the nest
is destroyed but Insectoids are still alive and win the battle, they die out
immediately after, leaving the square unoccupied by anyone.

1.  Arachas Nest:  
    Will spawn 8 Arachasae and either 1 Venomous Arachas or 1 Armoured Arachas
    (flip a coin) every 3 Combat Rounds

2.  Endrega Nest: Spawns 15 Endrega Workers and either 8 Endrega Drones or 2
    Endrega Warriors every 3 Combat Rounds

3.  Giant Centipede Nest:  
    Spawns 4 Giant Centipedes and 2 Pale Widows every 3 Combat Rounds

4.  Kikimore Nest:  
    Will spawn 8 Kikimore Workers and 2 Kikimore Warriors every 3 Combat Rounds  
    After 13 Combat Rounds, a Kikimore Queen is Spawned (gg, lul)

### Name: Vrihedd Sapper

**Category**: Support  
**Class**: Scoia’tael, Silver  
**Strength**: 0  
**Speed**: 2  
**Initiative**: 4  
**Cost**: 40  
**Limit**: 2 armies  
**Specials**:  
When fighting in enemy Fortified territory, the Sapper can undermine their
defenses, dealing 1 damage to fortifications, and +1 damage for every subsequent
undermining, up to a maximum of 5  
When fighting in allied Fortified territory, the Sapper can repair damaged
fortifications, repairing D4 damage each turn.  
When fighting in Open territories, the Sapper can attempt to build temporary
defensive structures and trenches in any combat row. For each Sapper, roll a D6.
For each 1-3, the sapper builds one level of their intended structure. In
extreme weather conditions, each 6 will instead reduce the level of the
structure by 1.  
The Defensive Structure can house up to 12 non-mounted units per level, halving
the damage they receive from ranged attacks and AOE spells, while enemy melee
units have to waste an extra movement to attack them. It also has 3 hit points
per level, and it can only be damaged by anti-building attacks. Siege attacks
(like balista’s) will hit normally. Fire damage might set it on fire (roll D6
per Fire attack, 6 lights it up) and will deal 2 damage to the building, while
also dealing D4 Fire damage to the units inside.  
The Trench can be dug in a row, reducing the Speed of 12 (per level) enemy units
that try to march through this row by 1. Enemy units that end their turn in the
Trench will receive +50% damage from allied Ranged and Siege attacks.

Unit Statistics and Properties \#7

Kovir & Poviss

The kingdom of Kovir & Poviss is mostly well known for its ability to evade
wars, rather than partake. Its “eternal neutrality” has allowed the economy,
society and science of the nation to evolve, which brought many military
innovations to the Koviri army, among other things. In the rare instances of
war, the highly equipped and well-trained soldiers of the kingdom in the far
north have proven their mettle, being able to outclass the armies of much larger
kingdoms or empires.  
  
As with any sophisticated army composition, the Koviri Infantrymen, namely the
Picchierres and the Condottieri, serve as the backbone, the latter of which are
also sent to fight for other kingdoms as mercenaries, for the right price. Even
though the soldiers are of the highest quality, their numbers are limited due to
the kingdom’s low population, and for this reason, an elite fighting unit was
financed by Kovir, Adieu’s Free Company, consisted of war veterans and savage
convicts and murderers, who were released on condition to die for their homeland
on the field.

The meat of the army is supported by Crossbowmen and a limited amount of
Paladins, heavily armoured cavalrymen, and mounted Arquebusiers, hard-hitting
mobile shooters that use a peculiar device that launches small metallic lumps
with the power of gunpowder.

Kovir’s loud embrace towards magic and science has brought many highly capable
scholars and magisters, who can spell doom for enemy nations, in the form of
either powerful spells, or innovative siege engines, like the Carambola, a large
and heavy tube that fires humongous cannonballs, which specializes in
obliterating fortifications or enemy siege units before they can even attempt to
fire back.

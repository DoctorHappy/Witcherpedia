Unit Statistics and Properties \#5

Nilfgaard

For an empire to expand to the corners of the continent, it must possess the
proper military to do so. With superior discipline and equipment, and the best
logistics and training, it is no wonder that Nilfgaard is already halfway there.  
Heavily armoured with top-quality platemail, the Alba and Daerlan soldiers form
the army’s meat, while the Impera Brigade serve as bodyguards to essential
personas. Protected behind the infantry lines, the Black Infantry Archers, and
the Impera Enforcers -with their shields on their backs- rain death upon the
enemy. The Venendal cavalry from Ebbing supports the army with quick assaults,
but the true mounted terror, a galloping Panzer wielding Warhammers, is called
Nausicaa.  
Sent to Korath desert, to protect the imperial borders, the Mange division, a
fast infantry unit, specializes in heat and drought. One step below exist the
slaves, from the conquered provinces, who serve as mediocre arrow fodder for the
empire’s cause.  
All these troops are accompanied by a plethora of scientists and craftsmen of
all sorts. From the Vicovarian Academy come the Novices, young mages who prove
their mettle through warfare, with the bulky Imperial Golems at their side. But
the true stars of Vicovaro are the Medics, with their bird masks and sharpened
scalpels. Alchemists from the capital mix compounds and put them in vials, for
their friends in the battlefield, or spray them on arrows, for their enemies in
the same place.  
This professional troupe is complemented by a vast number of siege engines and
Engineers, ready to repair any malfunction. The key to bringing cities to their
knees, Nilfgaard’s unethical specialty, the Rot Tosser, which flings rotten
carcasses over the enemy walls, allowing the Catriona plague to spread. Finally,
from Zerrikania in the far-east, comes the ultimate war machine, that shoots
exploding firebolts, that engulf whole battalions in their greenish flames.

-----------------------------------------

The Dryads of Brokilon possess mystical arcane powers, possibly gifted from
their symbiotic relations with the forest, or unlocked through the consumption
of the Water of Brokilon. Either way, they possess a mixture of offensive and
defensive spells, mainly conjuring ones, similar to the Druidic spell books.

### Name: Nature’s Wrath

**Type**: Cursing Spell  
**Essence Cost**: 20  
**Cooldown**: 4 Combat Rounds  
**Specifics**:  
Those that litter the sacred earth with blood are stricken with immense fear and
run for their lives. The number of bronze units struck with fear is equal to
(D10+5), and they immediately leave the battle site and rush to another
territory of the opponent’s choice. If these units are the last, or among the
last, surviving units, this action counts as retreat, and they probably suffer
Retreat Damage.

### Name: Entangling Roots

**Type**: Cursing Spell  
**Essence Cost**: 12  
**Cooldown**: 3 Combat Rounds after the effect’s end  
**Specifics**:  
The ground is torn by wild tree roots, that entangle a number of troops and
prevent them from moving, for 2 turns. This spell affects a (D6+4) number of
units, and it only prevents movement. So, ranged units can still attack, and
melee units engaged in combat can also fight off their opponents. Units under
this effect cannot perform any abilities involving movement, obviously (such as
Charge, Maneuver, or even Retreat)

### Name: Healing Wish

**Type**: Blessing Spell  
**Essence Cost**: 40  
**Cooldown**: 6 Combat Rounds  
**Specifics**:  
Heals (2D8+4) Dryads, but on -2 Initiative, on top of any further Healing. Can
only be cast within the Borders of Brokilon, and not after a battle has ended.

### Name: Conjure Leshen

**Type**: Summoning Spell  
**Essence Cost**: 35  
**Cooldown**: Once per battle  
**Specifics**:  
The most experienced Hierophants and Flaminicas can control even the fiercest
forces of the forests. A lessen is conjured to fight for the caster’s cause.
This leshen may summon packs of wolves, but at half the numbers.  
The stats, as always, can be found at the Bestiary File.

### Name: Conjure Treant

**Type**: Summoning Spell  
**Essence Cost**: 35  
**Cooldown**: Once per battle  
**Specifics**:  
Think something smart about Treants

_The stats, as always, can be found at the Bestiary File._

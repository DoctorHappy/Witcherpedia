The Northern Wars - Board Game
==============================

**A Tale of Cringe and Bullshittery**

### Aedirn / Lyria & Rivia

#### Overview

Aedirn and Lyria are somewhat smaller kingdoms, at least in comparison with the
major Northern Kingdoms. Lacking the sufficient numbers, some troops from Aedirn
or Lyria underwent a great specialization to fight off specific threats. Still,
the combined forces of the two nations match their neighboring ones.

Aedirn’s melee troops, the Cavaliers and the heavy-hitting Maulers, are donned
in platemail and brown gambesons. Complemented by some highly-trained
Longbowmen, this simple composition managed to keep the far-larger kingdom of
Kaedwen at bay.

Lyria & Rivia is a more compact and generally poorer kingdom. Its main force is
mainly comprised of poor inexperienced conscripts and half-skilled billmen. From
this realm also hail some of the most famous soldiers in the known world. The
Huszárok, or Hussars in Common, a light cavalry force which fights similarly to
Kaedwen’s Dun Banner, and the Lyrian Arbalists, who use rapid-fire crossbow
variations and are considered the best in the world.

The combined armies of these two nations are also followed by Rivian Warcriers,
who bolster their compatriots with their trumpets. Elite troops from Aedirn, the
Special Forces, armed with bows and swords, patrol the forests, searching for
Scoia’tael guerillas to hone their most practiced skill: Extermination.

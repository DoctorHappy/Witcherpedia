\*Caed Dhu Spellbook List of Spells\*

The Druids are scholars of the forest and nature, that typically live peaceful
lives. If the need arises though, they are able to defend their sacred grounds,
as they are capable casters in many fields of magic.

Name: Lightning Strike  
Type: Destructive Spell  
Essence Cost: 12  
Cooldown: 2 Combat Rounds  
Specifics: Deals (D4+2) lightning damage to a gathering of enemy bronze units.
Also Paralyzes an additional D4 units for 1 turn

Name: Nature’s Wrath  
Type: Cursing Spell  
Essence Cost: 20  
Cooldown: 4 Combat Rounds  
Specifics: Those that litter the sacred earth with blood are stricken with
immense fear and run for their lives. The number of bronze units struck with
fear is equal to (D10+5), and they immediately leave the battle site and rush to
another territory of the opponent’s choice. If these units are the last, or
among the last, surviving units, this action counts as retreat, and they
probably suffer Retreat Damage.

Name: Entangling Roots  
Type: Cursing Spell  
Essence Cost: 12  
Cooldown: 3 Combat Rounds after the effect’s end  
Specifics: The ground is torn by wild tree roots, that entangle a number of
troops and prevent them from moving, for 2 turns. This spell affects a (D6+4)
number of units, and it only prevents movement. So, ranged units can still
attack, and melee units engaged in combat can also fight off their opponents.
Units under this effect cannot perform any abilities involving movement,
obviously (such as Charge, Maneuver, or even Retreat)

Name: Conjure Leshen  
Type: Summoning Spell  
Essence Cost: 35  
Cooldown: Once per battle  
Specifics: The most experienced Hierophants and Flaminicas can control even the
fiercest forces of the forests. A lessen is conjured to fight for the caster’s
cause. This leshen may summon packs of wolves, but at half the numbers.  
The stats, as always, can be found at the Bestiary File.

Name: Conjure Treant  
Type: Summoning Spell  
Essence Cost: 35  
Cooldown: Once per battle  
Specifics: Think something smart about Treants

The stats, as always, can be found at the Bestiary File.

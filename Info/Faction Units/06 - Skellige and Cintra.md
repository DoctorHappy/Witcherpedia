The Northern Wars - Board Game
==============================

**A Tale of Cringe and Bullshittery**

### Skellige & Cintra

#### Overview

Cintra, a wealthy and strong coastal kingdom, bordering the intimidating
Nilfgaardian Empire to the south, reached its peak at the time of Queen
Calanthe, the lioness of Cintra. At her time, the kingdom had sufficient
resources to field an army of Heavy and Light infantry, Crossbowmen and Knights,
to protect itself. But that was not the accomplishment that made her famous.

Instead, it was the mating of the golden lion with the white bear, in the azure
fields and oceans, the strategic marriage with King Eist of the Skellige Isles,
that cemented Cintra’s position as both a land and marine powerhouse.

The six islands of Skellige are ruled by seven local Jarls with a general
independence, but act as one fist at their King’s call.

This clan-based culture creates an astonishing variety of troop combinations and
military techniques. Quick pillagers, with round shields and straight blades,
accompanied by half-naked men with claymores, heavily armoured Axe-men and
dark-clothed Poachers, all in the same battlefield. Sea-faring corsairs, who
excel at hijacking enemy vessels, and ballsy girls, armed with just a spear, who
fight polar bears for breakfast. Even musicians, inexperienced in combat, rush
into the fray, with their lutes and their insanity guiding them.

All this frenzied paranoia is accompanied by a more calm, collected, and dark
side of the Isles. Druid Circles are fairly common there, with Flaminicas and
Vaedermakars showing an intellectual approach with their arcane skills.
Worshippers of Freya are also very common, and many priestesses have
extraordinary healing powers. Rumors even suggest that worshippers of Svalblod
also dwell on the Isles, and legends speak of their grotesque shape-shifting
abilities…

\*Druid’s Spellbook List of Spells\*
------------------------------------

The Druids are scholars of the forest and nature, that typically live peaceful
lives. If the need arises though, they are able to defend their sacred grounds,
as they are capable casters in many fields of magic.

### Name: Lightning Strike

**Type**: Destructive Spell  
**Essence Cost**: 12  
**Cooldown**: 2 Combat Rounds  
**Specifics**:  
Deals (D4+2) lightning damage to a gathering of enemy bronze units. Also
Paralyzes an additional D4 units for 1 turn

### Name: Nature’s Wrath

**Type**: Cursing Spell  
**Essence Cost**: 20  
**Cooldown**: 4 Combat Rounds  
**Specifics**:  
Those that litter the sacred earth with blood are stricken with immense fear and
run for their lives. The number of bronze units struck with fear is equal to
(D10+5), and they immediately leave the battle site and rush to another
territory of the opponent’s choice. If these units are the last, or among the
last, surviving units, this action counts as retreat, and they probably suffer
Retreat Damage.

### Name: Entangling Roots

**Type**: Cursing Spell  
**Essence Cost**: 12  
**Cooldown**: 3 Combat Rounds after the effect’s end  
**Specifics**:  
The ground is torn by wild tree roots, that entangle a number of troops and
prevent them from moving, for 2 turns. This spell affects a (D6+4) number of
units, and it only prevents movement. So, ranged units can still attack, and
melee units engaged in combat can also fight off their opponents. Units under
this effect cannot perform any abilities involving movement, obviously (such as
Charge, Maneuver, or even Retreat)

### Name: Conjure Leshen

**Type**: Summoning Spell  
**Essence Cost**: 35  
**Cooldown**: Once per battle  
**Specifics**:  
The most experienced Hierophants and Flaminicas can control even the fiercest
forces of the forests. A lessen is conjured to fight for the caster’s cause.
This leshen may summon packs of wolves, but at half the numbers.  
The stats, as always, can be found at the Bestiary File.

them from using any kind of Ranged attacks or abilities. Units inside this cloud
are also immune to all kinds of Ranged attacks. The Cloud lasts for 3 turns, and
can change location.  
One turn after casting this spell, roll a D8. If it rolls a 7, a pack of Foglets
(D6+8) is summoned, hostile to everybody, which randomly attacks units around
the cloud. If it rolls an 8, an Ancient Foglet also joins the summoned Foglets
(this time it’s a D6+5 for their numbers)

### Name: Heavy Rain

**Essence Cost**: 50  
**Cooldown**: Once per battle.

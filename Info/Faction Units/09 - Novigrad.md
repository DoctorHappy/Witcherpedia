**Specials:**  
Can resurrect D6 bronze units every turn  
In non-siege battles, after the 1st combat round, this unit has a chance to get
damaged in the crossfire by non-focused attacks. For each Priest, roll a D10. If
it rolls 1, it dies.  
In Siege battles, the defender shall only roll D10 for the incoming non-focused
ranged/siege attacks. For melee/spell/etc. attacks, roll a D20 instead. Again,
if it rolls 1, a Priest dies  
After the battle is over, the player controlling the battle site can resurrect
(D6 – 1) bronze units for each Priest  
Instead of healing, the Priest can waste 2 turns to light a Sacred Flame. On the
start of the 3rd turn, on 5 Initiative, each Sacred Flame deals D4 Fire damage
to selected groups of units, enemy or allied, cancels any Magical effects these
units have, and prevents any new Magical effects of affecting them for the
remainder of the turn.  
Each Priest can light only one Flame per battle, and it keeps burning for the
remainder of the fight, as long as the Priest is alive. Additionally, the Flames
can burn out by the use of Dispelling spells, extreme weather conditions or by
Fire Absorbing abilities.

The Northern Wars - Board Game
==============================

**A Tale of Cringe and Bullshittery**

### Temeria

#### Overview

The Temerian army, dressed in ocean blue and silver lilies, is comprised of all
social classes. Esteemed Knights in shining armours, followed by basic
crossbowmen and infantry form the backbone, while drummers coordinate their
march.

Aretuza’s girls, some of the best mages in the world, are seen as war heroines
from Temerians, and plague the opposing forces with arcane spells, while
peasants and beggars, who took up arms for their country and formed the Poor
Fucking Infantry division, out-swarm the enemy troops, showing a surprising
valor and determination.

But in the outskirts of Vizima, the mountainous pass of Kalmat and the forests
of Velen, Temeria’s battle-hardened veterans reside. Almost invisible and
invincible, they are Temeria’s silent guardians, and watchful protectors, the
Blue Stripes.

Mahakam

The sturdy, iron-willed Dwarves of Mahakam protect their homeland with great
care, ensuring that nothing can pass through the paths of Mount Gorge without
their permission.  
They have formed the Mahakam Volunteer Army, to assist their Liege, the King of
Temeria, in times of War, and eagerly jump into the thickest of battle, to crush
their enemies under their boots.  
Their ranks are consisted by Heavy, slow-moving infantry, with dense,
mastercrafted platemail and spears or axes by their side, and experienced
Crossbowmen, using fast-firing Arbalests, who hide between the lines of Shield
Bearers, whose task is to keep their shields up and their allies safe.  
Further back, a gathering of experienced Craftsmen build and fix Armours of the
finest quality, and Alchemists create explosive substances, before rushing
between the enemy lines to set their war machines on fire.

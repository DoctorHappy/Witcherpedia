The Northern Wars - Board Game
==============================

**A Tale of Cringe and Bullshittery**

### Toussaint

#### Overview

_Born from the molten ashes of the surrounding mountain range  
The valley on which Toussaint has grown  
As if a fallen phoenix in its fiery grave  
The seeds of fairytales has sown_

_In sun-doused dawns and starry nights  
The Duchy stays tipsy on wine  
And in the vineyards of Dun Tynne  
Fair maidens find their gallant knights_

_But deep down in the hollow mines  
Trapped in this realm since ancient times  
Eternal unseen beings reside  
Hence fables and deceits collide_

<p>The Northern Wars - Board Game</p>
<p>A Tale of Cringe and Bullshittery</p>
<p>Unit Statistics and Properties #4</p>
<p>Aedirn / Lyria &amp; Rivia</p>
<p>Aedirn and Lyria are somewhat smaller kingdoms, at least in comparison with the major Northern Kingdoms. Lacking the sufficient numbers, some troops from Aedirn or Lyria underwent a great specialization to fight off specific threats. Still, the combined forces of the two nations match their neighboring ones.<br />
Aedirn’s melee troops, the Cavaliers and the heavy-hitting Maulers, are donned in platemail and brown gambesons. Complemented by some highly-trained Longbowmen, this simple composition managed to keep the far-larger kingdom of Kaedwen at bay.<br />
Lyria &amp; Rivia is a more compact and generally poorer kingdom. Its main force is mainly comprised of poor inexperienced conscripts and half-skilled billmen. From this realm also hail some of the most famous soldiers in the known world. The Hus<strong>zár</strong>ok, or Hussars in Common, a light cavalry force which fights similarly to Kaedwen’s Dun Banner, and the Lyrian Arbalists, who use rapid-fire crossbow variations and are considered the best in the world.<br />
The combined armies of these two nations are also followed by Rivian Warcriers, who bolster their compatriots with their trumpets. Elite troops from Aedirn, the Special Forces, armed with bows and swords, patrol the forests, searching for Scoia’tael guerillas to hone their most practiced skill: Extermination.</p>
